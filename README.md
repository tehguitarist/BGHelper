# BGHelper
Bug tracking and feature request repo for the BGHelper app.

If you have any feature requests or bug reports, please make an issue here.

Please note, I do not intend to replace high production value apps for board games, and will consider them on a case by case basis. Adding custom rules like the science scoring in 7 Wonders or even the bonus points in Sheriff of Nottingham isn't the easiest task for me, but happy to explore things.
